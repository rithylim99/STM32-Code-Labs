# STM32-Code-Labs
To be able to coding STM32, first we have to download Cube IDE by url: "https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html"

# What is Cube IDE?

STM32CubeIDE is an all-in-one multi-OS development tool, which is part of the STM32Cube software ecosystem1. It’s an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors1.

It is based on the Eclipse®/CDT™ framework and GCC toolchain for the development, and GDB for the debugging1. It allows the integration of the hundreds of existing plugins that complete the features of the Eclipse® IDE1.

STM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer an all-in-one tool experience and save installation and development time1. After the selection of an empty STM32 MCU or MPU, or preconfigured microcontroller or microprocessor from the selection of a board or the selection of an example, the project is created and initialization code generated1.

At any time during the development, the user can return to the initialization and configuration of the peripherals or middleware and regenerate the initialization code with no impact on the user code1. STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user with useful information about project status and memory requirements1.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer interface, or fault analyzer1.
